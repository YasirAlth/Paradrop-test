Chute Configuration Files
=============================

There are 2 files that are important to the use of Paradrop and installing chutes.

* *config.yaml* - contains high level information about the chute for the host OS (like WiFi SSID's that need to be setup)
* *Dockerfile* - contains internal chute actions to setup the chute (like what OS version to use)

Eventually these will all fold into one glorious configuration file, but at this early stage we keep them separate.
