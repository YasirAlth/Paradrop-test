Developing Applications
=======================================

This section of the document is devoted to describing the edge computing
services (chutes) that run on ParaDrop. There are two categories of ParaDrop
applications - pure edge applications and cloud-edge hybrid applications. The
pure edge applications have standalone chutes, which can be deployed in the
ParaDrop routers. Cloud-edge hybrid applications have both a cloud component
and an edge component. In this section, we will focus on the chute development,
in other words, the edge component.
