The Wi-Fi router is the last always-on, always-connected, ubiquitous device in the home today. At Paradrop Labs, we believe that some (if not most) cloud or smart-hub services should actually exist on Wi-Fi routers.Read our [paper](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~suman/courses/707/papers/paradrop-sec2016.pdf) or visit our [website](https://www.paradrop.org) to learn more!## What can I do with Paradrop?Since Wi-Fi routers are the central nervous system for all Internet based services in the home, the possibilities are quite endless. We have implemented many example applications, you can see the source code [here](https://github.com/ParadropLabs/Example-Apps). We encourage you to test out Paradrop by cloning our repo and checking out our [getting started](http://paradrop.readthedocs.org/en/latest/#getting-started) page.## Get StartedParadrop uses Docker containers to run edge computing services, butParadrop itself can also run as a Docker container. This is a goodoption if you want to try out Paradrop's core functionality withoutusing special hardware or changing your operating system.### Docker Container in Safe ModeRun the following command if you only want to test the core edgecomputing functionality.  This will allow you to install and removechutes, experiment with the edge API and connect the node to the cloudcontroller. Since this command creates a container separated from thehost network, Paradrop will not be able to manage the network interfaces,wireless networks, and firewall settings of the host operating system.```bashdocker run --privileged --name paradrop --publish 8080:80 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock paradrop/daemon```After the Paradrop daemon is running, you can access the admin panel witha web browser by going to http://localhost:8080. If prompted, enter theuser name *paradrop* and no password. You can also use `pdtools node`commands such as the `install-chute` command. The following exampleassumes you are running it from a directory containing the source codefor a chute, which means there should be a valid *paradrop.yaml* filein the directory.```bashpdtools node --target localhost:8080 install-chute```### Docker Container with Host Network AccessRun the following command if you want to test all of Paradrop's functions.Giving the Paradrop container access to the host network stack will enableit to manage network interfaces, wireless networks, and firewall settings.By default, Paradrop will try to create a wireless access point using oneof the machine's WiFi interfaces. **Warning:** because Paradrop will makepotentially disruptive system configuration changes, we do not recommendrunning Paradrop using the following command on a workstation that youuse for other purposes. Consider running it in a virtual machine instead.```bashdocker run --privileged --name paradrop --net=host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock paradrop/daemon```You can access the Paradrop node in the same way as described in theSafe Mode section above. However, the node is listening directly onthe host port 80. That means you can access http://localhost or use`pdtools node --target localhost`.## Preparing a new release1. Merge changes into the master branch.2. Run `./pdbuild.sh release <version>` to update version number and tag the release.3. Run `./pdbuild.sh build` to build a new snap.4. Run `./pdbuild.sh image` to build a new disk image.
